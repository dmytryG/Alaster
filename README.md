Simple and powerful imgur parser

The parser takes arguments from command promt. First argument in the amount of active threads (Depends on powerful of your pc and internet connection, highly not recommended to set too much because of IP-blocking of imgur). Argument after can be set True or False it's flag that selects whether you wanna use own path for storing data. The last argument is the path to folder for saving photos.

The setup.bat script is creating and setting up virtual python environment. The run_local.bat script runs parser with preseted arguments.
